## <a id='1-4-0'></a> v1.4.0

**Release Date**: January 10, 2023

### <a id="1-4-0-tap-new-features"></a> Tanzu Application Platform new features

- [Shared Ingress Issuer](security-and-compliance/ingress-certificates.hbs.md) for secure ingress
  communication by default. [CNRs](cloud-native-runtimes/about.hbs.md), [AppSSO](app-sso/about.hbs.md),
  and [Tanzu Application Platform GUI](tap-gui/about.hbs.md) use this issuer to secure
  ingress. In future releases, all Tanzu Application Platform components will be incrementally updated
  to support the shared ingress issuer.
- [Namespace Provisioner](namespace-provisioner/about.hbs.md) provides a secure, automated
  way for Platform Operators to provision namespaces with the resources and proper namespace-level
  privileges required for their workloads to function as intended.
- [Tanzu Application Platform Telemetry Reports](telemetry/overview.hbs.md#tanzu-application-platform-usage-reports)
offers the option to enroll in a usage reporting program that provides a usage summary of your Tanzu Application Platform.

#### <a id="1-4-0-appsso-nf"></a> Application Single Sign-On (AppSSO)

- Added ability to configure custom Redis storage for an `AuthServer` by
  using a ProvisionedService-style API. For more information, see
  [Storage](app-sso/service-operators/storage.hbs.md).
- Added package field `default_authserver_clusterissuer` that inherits
  the `shared.ingress_issuer` value from Tanzu Application Platform if not set.
  For more information, see [IssuerURI and TLS](app-sso/service-operators/issuer-uri-and-tls.hbs.md).
- Added `AuthServer.spec.tls.deactivated` to deprecate `AuthServer.spec.tls.disabled`.
- `AuthServer.spec.tokenSignatures` is now a required field.
- In addition to globally trusted CA certificates, granular trust can be extended with `AuthServer.spec.caCerts`.
- LDAP is now a supported identity provider protocol. For more information, see [LDAP](app-sso/service-operators/identity-providers.hbs.md#ldap).
  - LDAP bind is validated on `AuthServer` creation when an LDAP identity provider is defined.
  - Introduced `identityProviders.ldap.url` in `AuthServer.spec`.
  - Introduced `identityProviders.ldap.group.search`.
  - `identityProviders.ldap.group` is now optional in `AuthServer.spec`.
</br></br>

#### <a id="1-4-0-app-live-view"></a> Application Live View

- Users can now activate or deactivate the automatic configuration of Spring Boot actuators on Tanzu Application Platform and on workloads.
  For more information, see [Configure and access Spring Boot actuators in Tanzu Application Platform](spring-boot-conventions/configuring-spring-boot-actuators.hbs.md).
- Added App Live View Memory View panel in Visual Studio Code as part of Spring Boot Dashboard extension.
- Added support for Spring Boot 3.
- Added new App Live View pages `HTTP Requests` and `Request Mappings` for Steeltoe workloads.
- Added `appliveview_connnector.backend.sslDeactivated` to deprecate `appliveview_connnector.backend.sslDisabled`.

</br></br>

#### <a id="1-4-0-tap-gui-plugin-nf"></a> Tanzu Application Platform GUI Plug-ins

</br></br>

#### <a id='scc-plug-in-new-features'></a>Supply Chain Choreographer Plug-in

- Events are now emitted when resources are applied and when their output or health status changes.
  See [Events reference](scc/events.hbs.md).
- Source Tester stage now includes a link to the Jenkins job when Jenkins is configured for use
  in the supply chain.
- `spec.source.git.url` is added to the Overview section of the Source Provider stage in the
  supply chain.
- Added support to include current and historical Kaniko build logs in the Stage Details section of
  the supply chain when Kaniko is used as the build service in the Image Provider stage.
- Scanning stages now include a `Show Unique CVEs` filter so that the scan results show one CVE
  per ID as opposed to each CVE per package.
  This allows better alignment between the data in the Supply Chain Choreographer plug-in and the
  Security Analysis plug-in.
- **View Approvals** is relocated to the `Config Writer` stage, instead of being a stage by itself.
</br></br>

#### <a id='sagui-plug-in-new-features'></a>Security Analysis Plug-in

- Vulnerabilities by Severity widget and CVEs column will count all CVEs across all packages
- In the CVE details page, there is now an Impacted Workload Builds table listing out all workloads
  that are affected by the CVE.

  simultaneously debug the updated code, without having to deactivate Live Update when debugging.
</br></br>

#### <a id="1-4-0-vs-new-features"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio

- **See code updates running on-cluster in seconds:**
  By using Live Update facilitated by Tilt, deploy your workload once, save changes to the code
  and then, seconds later, see those changes reflected in the workload running on the cluster.
  All Live Update output is filtered to its own output pane window within Visual Studio.

- **Debug workloads directly on the cluster:**
  Debug your application in a production-like environment by debugging on your Kubernetes cluster that
  has Tanzu Application Platform. An environment’s similarity to production relies on keeping
  dependencies updated, among other variables.

#### <a id="1-4-0-api-validation-and-scoring"></a> API Validation and Scoring Toolkit

- API Validation and Scoring focuses on scanning and validating an OpenAPI specification. The API
  specification is generated from the API Auto Registration of Tanzu Application Platform. See [API
  Validation and Scoring](api-validation-scoring/about.hbs.md) for more information.
</br></br>

#### <a id="1-4-0-intellij-new-feat"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for IntelliJ

  contents from file is applied.
- Added ability for users to pass URL for `--file` flag.
- Added show fully qualified resource name in the resources column of Supply chain and Delivery
  sections of the `tanzu apps workload get` command.
- Added new shorthand flag aliases: `-a` for `--app`, `-e` for `--env`, `-i` for `--image`,
  `-l` for `label`, `-p` for `--param`, and `-t` for `--type`.
- Added emojis to `tanzu apps workload create/apply/delete` commands.
- Added do not print emojis when `--no-color` flag  is set.

### <a id='1-4-0-breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes

This release has the following breaking changes, listed by area and component.

#### <a id="1-4-0-appsso-bc"></a> Application Single Sign-On (AppSSO)

- Removed `AuthServer.spec.identityProvider.ldap.group.search{Filter,Base,Depth,SubTree}` and
  introduced `ldap.group.search: {}`.
  - If `ldap.group` is defined and `ldap.group.search` is not defined, the LDAP is considered
      an ActiveDirectory style LDAP and groups are loaded from the user's `memberOf` attribute.
  - If `ldap.group` and `ldap.group.search` are both defined, the LDAP is considered a Classic
      LDAP and group search is done by searching in the `ldap.group.search.base`.
  - There used to be a mixed mode, when both searches were attempted every time.
- Removed `AuthServer.spec.identityProviders.ldap.server` field.
- Removed `AuthServer.status.deployments.authServer.lastParentGenerationWithRestart` field.
- Removed deprecated field `AuthServer.spec.issuerURI`. For more information, see [IssuerURI and TLS](./app-sso/service-operators/issuer-uri-and-tls.hbs.md).
</br></br>

#### <a id="1-4-0-supply-chain-templates"></a> Out of the Box Supply Chain Templates

In a multi-cluster setup, when a Deliverable is created on a Build profile cluster,
the ConfigMap it is placed in is renamed from `<workload-name>` to `<workload-name>-deliverable`. Any automation
depending on obtaining the Deliverable content by the former name must be updated to use the new name.
For more information, see [Multicluster Tanzu Application Platform overview](multicluster/about.hbs.md).

#### <a id="1-4-0-intellij-bc"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for IntelliJ

- IntelliJ IDEA v2022.2 to v2022.3 is required to install the extension.
</br></br>

#### <a id="1-4-0-vscode-bc"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio Code

- `Tanzu Debug` no longer port forwards the application port (8080).
</br></br>

#### <a id="1-4-0-tap-gui-bc"></a> Tanzu Application Platform GUI

##### Ingress URL

As mentioned in the [new features section](#1-4-0-tap-new-features), Tanzu Application Platform GUI
participates in the shared ingress issuer feature.
As such, if you have explicitly set the fields `tap_gui.app_config.app.baseUrl`,
`tap_gui.app_config.backend.baseUrl`, or `tap_gui.app_config.backend.cors.origin` with the scheme
`http` then you must change the scheme to `https`, as in this example:

  ```yaml
  # tap-values.yaml
  tap_gui:
    app_config:
      app:
        baseUrl: https://tap-gui.INGRESS-DOMAIN/
      backend:
        baseUrl: https://tap-gui.INGRESS-DOMAIN/
        cors:
          origin: https://tap-gui.INGRESS-DOMAIN/
  ```

  Where `INGRESS-DOMAIN` is the ingress domain you have configured for Tanzu Application Platform.

##### Communication with Supply Chain Security Tools - Store

In previous version of TAP, users were asked to configure the TAP GUI to use the read-only access token to communicate with Supply Chain Security Tools - Store.
In v1.4, users need to use the read-write access token in order to use new features in the Security Analysis GUI plugin.
Users upgrading from v1.3 should update their TAP GUI configuration.
See the updated instructions in [Enable CVE scan results](tap-gui/plugins/scc-tap-gui.hbs.md#scan).

#### <a id="1-4-0-scst-scan-bc"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

- **Deprecated and removed ScanTemplates:**

  Deprecated Grype ScanTemplates shipped with Tanzu Application Platform v1.1 and earlier are
  removed and no longer supported. Use Grype ScanTemplates v1.2 and later.

- **Deprecation notice for `docker` field and related sub-fields:**

  The `docker` field and related sub-fields used in Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan are
  deprecated and marked for removal in Tanzu Application Platform v1.7.0.
  The deprecation impacts Scan Controller, Grype Scanner, and Snyk Scanner.
  Carbon Black Scanner is not impacted.
  For information about the migration path, see
  [Troubleshooting](scst-scan/observing.hbs.md#unable-to-pull-scanner-controller-images).
</br></br>

#### <a id="1-4-0-ipw-bc"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Image Policy Webhook

The Image Policy Webhook component is removed in Tanzu Application Platform v1.4. This component is deprecated
in favor of the [Policy Controller](./scst-policy/overview.hbs.md).
</br></br>

#### <a id="1-4-0-policy-controller-bc"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy Controller

Policy Controller no longer initializes TUF by default. TUF is required to
support the keyless authorities in `ClusterImagePolicy`. To continue to use
keyless authorities, provide the value `policy.tuf_enabled:
true` by using the `tap-values.yaml` while upgrading. By default,
the public Sigstore The Update Framework (TUF) server is used. To
target an alternative Sigstore stack, specify `policy.tuf_mirror` and
`policy.tuf_root`.

### <a id='1-4-0-security-fixes'></a> Security fixes

This release has the following security fixes, listed by area and component.

#### <a id='1-4-0-scst-grype-fixes'></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Grype

- `python` is updated to `3.7.5-22.ph3`.

</br>

### <a id='1-4-0-resolved-issues'></a> Resolved issues

The following issues, listed by area and component, are resolved in this release.

#### <a id="1-4-0-api-auto-registration-ri"></a> API Auto Registration

- API Auto Registration periodically checks the original API specification from the defined
  location to find changes and registers any changes into the `API Descriptor`. This triggers
  reconciliation into the Tanzu Application Platform GUI catalog. This synchronization period or
  frequency is configurable through the new value `sync_period`. The default value is 5 minutes.
</br></br>

#### <a id="1-4-0-appsso-ri"></a> Application Single Sign-On (AppSSO)

- Fixed infinite redirect loops for an `AuthServer` configured with a single OIDC or SAML identity provider.
- Authorization Code request rejected audit event from anonymous users logging proper IP address.
- `AuthServer` no longer attempts to configure Redis event listeners.
- OpenShift: custom `SecurityContextConstraint` resource is created for Kubernetes platforms
  versions 1.23.x and lower.
- LDAP error log now contains proper error message.
</br></br>


#### <a id="1-4-0-supply-chain-templates-resolved"></a> Out of the Box Supply Chain Templates

Fixed deliverable content written into ConfigMaps in multi-cluster setup:

- ConfigMap is renamed to avoid conflict with `config-template`.
- Labels to attribute the Deliverable content with the supply chain and template are now added to be consistent with the ordinary Delivery on a non-Build profile cluster.

For more information, see [Multicluster Tanzu Application Platform overview](multicluster/about.hbs.md).

#### <a id="1-4-0-apps-cli-plugin-ri"></a> Tanzu CLI Apps Plug-in

- Fixed `tanzu apps workload tail` command output, which was displaying extra init container log lines.
- Fixed `tanzu apps workload tail` command not including all logs.
</br></br>

#### <a id="1-4-0-tap-gui-plugin-ri"></a> Tanzu Application Platform GUI plug-ins

- **Immediate entity provider backend plug-in**

  - The entity provider, used mainly by API Auto Registration, now allows a body size of `5Mb` to
    accept larger API specifications.
  - Considering the restriction of Backstage for [Entity Provider mutations](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/external-integrations#provider-mutations),
    whenever an existing entity is intended for a mutation through this plug-in, and its origin is
    a different entity provider, a `409 Conflict` error is returned.
</br></br>

#### <a id="supply-chain-plugin-ri"></a> Supply Chain Choreographer Plug-In

- The UI no longer shows the error `Unable to retrieve details from Image Provider Stage` when the
  Builder is not available or configured. It now correctly shows the same error as the CLI,
  `Builder default is not ready`.

</br>

</br>

### <a id='1-4-0-known-issues'></a> Known issues

This release has the following known issues, listed by area and component.

#### <a id="1-4-0-app-acc-vscode-ki"></a> Application Accelerator for Visual Studio Code

- When using custom types, if there is a check box in the list of attributes then the re-ordering
  of the inputs doesn't work.

#### <a id="1-4-0-intellij-ki"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for IntelliJ

- If a workload is deployed onto a namespace by using Live Update, you must set that namespace as
  the namespace of the current context of your kubeconfig file.
  Otherwise, if you run Tanzu Debug it causes the workload to re-deploy.
  For more information, see
  [Troubleshooting](intellij-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#debug-reapplies-apply).

- On macOS, Tanzu Panel might be empty when using a GKE cluster. For more information, see
  [Troubleshooting](intellij-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#panel-empty-gke).

- The **Describe** action in the pop-up menu in the Activity panel can fail when used on PodIntent
  resources. For more information, see
  [Troubleshooting](intellij-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#describe-action-fail).

- The Tanzu panel might show workloads without showing Kubernetes resources in the center panel of the
  activity pane. For more information, see
  [Troubleshooting](intellij-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#tnz-panel-k8s-rsrc-fail).

- The Details table and Messages pane in the activity panel can show stale data because these views
  only refresh when the selection in the Resource tree is changed.
  As a workaround, make the views refresh by clicking somewhere in the Resource tree to change the
  current selection.

#### <a id="1-4-0-vs-ki"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio

- The `Tanzu: Delete Workload` command can fail with the extension erroneously reporting that the
  workload isn't running. For more information, see
  [Troubleshooting](vs-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#del-wrkld-not-running).

- The `Tanzu: Start Live Update` command can fail because the specified path was not found.
  For more information, see [Troubleshooting](vs-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#lv-update-path-not-found).

#### <a id="1-4-0-vs-app-acc"></a> Tanzu Application Accelerator for VS Code

- When using custom types, if there is a checkbox in the list of attributes, the re ordering
  of the inputs won't work

#### <a id="1-4-0-grype-scan-known-issues"></a>Grype scanner

**Scanning Java source code that uses Gradle package manager might not reveal vulnerabilities:**

For most languages, Source Code Scanning only scans files present in the source code repository.
Except for support added for Java projects using Maven, no network calls fetch
dependencies. For languages using dependency lock files, such as Golang and Node.js, Grype uses the
lock files to check dependencies for vulnerabilities.

For Java using Gradle, dependency lock files are not guaranteed, so Grype uses dependencies
present in the built binaries, such as `.jar` or `.war` files.

Because VMware discourages committing binaries to source code repositories, Grype fails to
find vulnerabilities during a source scan.
The vulnerabilities are still found during the image scan after the binaries are built and packaged
as images.
</br></br>

#### <a id="1-4-0-tap-gui-plugin-ki"></a> Tanzu Application Platform GUI plug-ins

##### <a id="supply-chain-plugin-ki"></a> Supply Chain Choreographer plug-in

- The `Generation` field in the **Overview** section does not update when a scan policy is amended.
  However, clicking the `Scan Policy` link shows the most current scan policy details applied
  to the stage.
- Customizing the `Source Tester` stage in an OOTB supply chain does not show details in the
  **Stage Details** section.

</br>

##### <a id="sec-analysis-plugin-ki"></a> Security Analysis plug-in

- The **No Associated Policy** tab in Workload Build Vulnerabilities does not show workloads that lack
  associated scan policies.
- The CVEs bar graph in Workload Build Vulnerabilities sometimes cuts numbers off.

</br>
